  ### Description:
      The worn traveler had finally reached the point of no return.  His weapons had been tested and his allies had come to his aide.  All that was left was to see how people would React to his feats and to finish the final quest.  While he knew the final object was still ahead, he thought it was a good time to reflect on all that he knew and what he had accomplished.  He would prepare a wall to boast of his achiements.  It would turn things on its head and reveal to the world the horrors of the trails that lay in his wake.
      While it wasn't the quest for the golden apples, he had learned plenty.  He had learned that there is always a more complicated way to achieve the same thing and that simple tasks could end up in the death of a keyboard.  He had pushed so many buttons along the way casuing so much pain.  But mainly, he learned what Sisyphus already knew.  The rock never gets up that hill!
